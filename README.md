## Project overview

* The project is the start of something new! I took this homework assignment as a challenge to build a real portfolio I intend to include on technology-focused resumes moving forward. I intend for the pages to be a resource for employers to get to know my work and probe me for more answers during interviews.

* My portfolio and its pages is a work-in-progress. As I continue my bootcamp journey, I intend to add/remove/replace projects depending on the job posting.

## About Me

* The 'About Me' page takes on new skills including:
    * Page layouts
    * Responsive view
    * Utilizing Bootstrap content
    * Rows & Columns
    * Google fonts

* I still find myself toying with margins, widths and additional CSS styling elements until I see my desired outcome.

* The background-color for this page was also a journey - I enjoyed the trial-and-error to figure out what element controlled the background-color for several different areas on the page.

## Portfolio

* I learned a lot from image sizing. None of the images rendered well from the beginning. Trial & error to get to the final product that was responsive and still asthetically pleasing.

* I taught myself how to embed a website into an image. I also taught myself how to add a border to a photo and include into one class for multiple images.

## Additional learnings

* I was able to delete a repo via GitHub after realizing I spelled the folder name incorrectly. That led me to deleting the local folder associated with it via console. My computer would not let me delete the folder the "old fashioned way" and I appreciated the 'forced' learning. I was happy with the outcome.

* I'm proud of the progress I've made in a short week re creating a readme file for a site. I feel more confident in how to host images, write a bulleted list and provide a TOC for every file.
